# The gstack review skill is interactive (Codex/Cursor/Claude) and cannot be
# invoked from bash. This hook requires an explicit attestation that the
# author (or agent) already ran the review skill on the staged work.
#
# Usage:
#   GSTACK_REVIEWED=1 git commit ...
# Emergency:
#   SKIP_GSTACK_REVIEW=1 git commit ...   # justify in commit/PR body

Bash cannot run the interactive gstack skill. Before committing:
  1. In your AI session, run ${GSTACK_REVIEW_COMMAND} on this branch/diff
  2. Fix must-fix findings (see fluentwork-meta/agents/shared/review-gate.md)
  3. Retry with attestation:
       GSTACK_REVIEWED=1 git commit ...

Emergency bypass (justify in commit/PR body):
       SKIP_GSTACK_REVIEW=1 git commit ...
